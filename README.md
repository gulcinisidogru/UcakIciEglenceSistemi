# ✈️ UÇAK İÇİ EĞLENCE SİSTEMİ 

This repository contains all essential assets and documentation related to our in-flight entertainment system project designed for children aged 6–9. The project includes UML diagrams, user interface designs, a detailed project presentation, and a demo video showcasing the gameplay and educational flow of the app.

## 🎯 Project Overview

"Uçak İçi Eğlence Sistemi" is a mobile game designed for in-flight entertainment. Children scan a QR code to download the app and are introduced to **Angelo**, their game companion. Together, they explore cities by answering educational questions. Correct answers trigger **AR (Augmented Reality)** experiences where Angelo or a landmark of the city appears.

The game aims to:
- Make learning about Turkish cities fun and interactive
- Provide an AR-supported educational experience
- Offer a safe and simple interface for children
