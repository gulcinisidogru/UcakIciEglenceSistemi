# ✈️ UÇAK İÇİ EĞLENCE SİSTEMİ 

This repository contains all essential assets and documentation related to our in-flight entertainment system project designed for children aged 6–9. The project includes UML diagrams, user interface designs, a detailed project presentation, and a demo video showcasing the gameplay and educational flow of the app.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

"Uçak İçi Eğlence Sistemi" is a mobile game designed for in-flight entertainment. Children scan a QR code to download the app and are introduced to **Angelo**, their game companion. Together, they explore cities by answering educational questions. Correct answers trigger **AR (Augmented Reality)** experiences where Angelo or a landmark of the city appears.

The game aims to:
- Make learning about Turkish cities fun and interactive
- Provide an AR-supported educational experience
- Offer a safe and simple interface for children

# UML Diagrams

This repository contains the initial set of UML diagrams (v1) created for the [Project Name] software system. These diagrams are used to visualize different aspects of the system, including its structure, behavior, and deployment model.

## 📌 Included Diagrams

- **Use Case Diagram:** Shows the interactions between users (actors) and the system.
- **Class Diagram:** Represents the structure of the system by showing classes and relationships.
- **Object Diagram:** Displays instances of classes at a specific time.
- **Sequence Diagram:** Illustrates how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case.
- **Activity Diagram:** Describes the workflow and business processes.
- **State Diagram:** Shows the states of a system or object and the transitions between states.
- **Component Diagram:** Depicts the organization and dependencies among software components.
- **Deployment Diagram:** Describes the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.
- **Gantt Diagram:** Visualizes the project timeline and task planning.

## 📁 File Format

All diagrams are included in `.png` format and are named according to their type and version, e.g., `class_diagram_v1.png`.

## 🔄 Versioning

This is the **v1** release of the UML diagrams. Future versions will be added as the project evolves.
